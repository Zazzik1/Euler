# Euler method
In mathematics, the Euler method is used to approximate the values of differential equations. 
# Examples
- ```exp.py```
It shows the influence of the step size on the quality of the approximation, compares the values with the true ones, and shows the size of the relative error using dy/dx=y as an example.

- ```yeast.py```
This program simulates the process of yeast growth in nitrogen-limited fermentation using a system of differential equations. Currently under development.
